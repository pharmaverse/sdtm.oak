# Controlled terminology examples

## Introduction

The folder inst/ct is meant to hold examples of controlled terminology
specifications. These example files should be plain CSV files.

If you're adding new example files please follow the naming convention:
`ct-<DD>-<keyword>.csv`, where `<DD>` is a simple numerical identifier
for the example, i.e. 01, 02, etc.. The `<keyword>` is a short keyword
providing a simple contextual annotation for the controlled terminology.

For example, `ct-01-cm.csv` is an example of a controlled terminology
specification data set:

- `01`: indicates that it is the first example
- `cm`: suggests that this data set is related to the Concomitant Medication
domain.

## Examples

- `ct-01-cm.csv`: TBD.
