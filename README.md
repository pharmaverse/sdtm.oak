<!-- badges: end -->

An EDC and Data Standard agnostic solution that enables the
pharmaceutical programming community to develop SDTM datasets in R. The
reusable algorithms concept in `{sdtm.oak}` provides a framework for
modular programming and also can automate SDTM creation based on the
standard SDTM spec.

## Installation

The package is available from CRAN and can be installed with:

``` r
install.packages("sdtm.oak")
```

You can install the development version of `{sdtm.oak}` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/sdtm.oak/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pharmaverse/sdtm.oak")
```

## Challenges with SDTM at the Industry Level

- Raw Data Structure: Data from different EDC systems come in varying
  structures, with different variable names, dataset names, etc.

- Varying Data Collection Standards: Despite the availability of CDASH,
  pharmaceutical companies still create different eCRFs using CDASH
  standards.

Due to the differences in raw data structures and data collection
standards, it may seem impossible to develop a common approach for
programming SDTM datasets.

## GOAL

`{sdtm.oak}` aims to address this issue by providing an EDC-agnostic,
standards-agnostic solution. It is an open-source R package that offers
a framework for the modular programming of SDTM in R. With future
releases; it will also strive to automate the creation of SDTM datasets
based on the metadata-driven approach using standard SDTM
specifications.

## Scope

Our goal is to use `{sdtm.oak}` to program most of the domains specified
in SDTMIG (Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human
Clinical Trials) and SDTMIG-AP (Study Data Tabulation Model
Implementation Guide: Associated Persons). This R package is based on
the core concept of `algorithms`, implemented as functions capable of
carrying out the SDTM mappings for any domains listed in the CDISC
SDTMIG and across different versions of SDTM IGs. The design of these
functions allows users to specify a raw dataset and a variable name(s)
as parameters, making it EDC (Electronic Data Capture) agnostic. As long
as the raw dataset and variable name(s) exist, `{sdtm.oak}` will execute
the SDTM mapping using the selected function. Itâ€™s important to note
that `{sdtm.oak}` may not handle sponsor-specific details related to
managing metadata for LAB tests, unit conversions, and coding
information, as many companies have unique business processes. With
subsequent releases, strive to automate SDTM creation using a
metadata-driven approach based on a standard SDTM specification format.

## Road Map

This Release: The V0.1.0 release of `{sdtm.oak}` users can create the
majority of the SDTM domains. Domains that are NOT in scope for the
V0.1.0 release are DM, Trial Design Domains, SV, SE, RELREC, Associated
Person domains, and EPOCH Variable across all domains.

Subsequent Releases: We are planning to develop the below features in
the subsequent releases.  
- Functions required to derive reference date variables in the DM
domain.  
- Metadata driven automation based on the standardized SDTM
specification.  
- Functions required to program the EPOCH Variable.  
- Functions to derive standard units and results based on metadata.

## Feedback

We ask users to follow the mentioned approach and try `{sdtm.oak}` to
map any SDTM domains supported in this release. Users can also utilize
the test data in the package to become familiar with the concepts before
attempting on their own data. Please get in touch with us using one of
the recommended approaches listed below:
