# Contribution to {oak} 

This outlines how to propose a change to the aok package. For more detailed info
about contributing to {oak}, and other [pharmaverse
packages](https://pharmaverse.org/), please see the [development process
guide](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/main/articles/development_process.html)
as well as other Developer Guides in the Articles section of the [{admiral}
website](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/index.html)

# Basics
 * For each new contribution, the user creates an issue on the issue tab on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/oak/issues) to put it in our backlog.
The issues can range from bug identification and/or fixes, enhancements to
functions, documentation, tests or new features.

 * We advise you to contact us when an 
[issue](https://github.com/pharmaverse/oak/issues) is created via
[Slack](https://oakgarden.slack.com) (If you don't have access, use this
[link](https://join.slack.com/t/oakgarden/shared_invite/zt-204sf8w5c-Vxl71cI~WAYhsMLbHGxeMw)
to join).  We can discuss details or align expectations if you are not familiar
with the `{oak}` philosophy and programming strategy. The team will try to
review the issues within the next backlog meeting and give some initial
feedback. Since we are not a 100% fully resourced software development team it
might be that some issues will take longer to respond to depending on the amount
of overall issues.

 * Familiarize yourself with our [programming strategy](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/main/articles/programming_strategy.html), guidance for [GitHub usage](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/main/articles/git_usage.html) and [unit testing](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/main/articles/unit_test_guidance.html).

 * All newly [created issues](https://github.com/pharmaverse/oak/issues) will be
reviewed within the next backlog meeting and the creator will receive an
initial feedback via a comment. Someone from the core development team will
then triage new issues by assigning the appropriate labels (such as “user
request” so we can easily identify new requests).
 
 * Issues are meant to be taken on by users from the Pharma programming
community.

# Contribution Model


## Type 1 Contribution with Code: 

 * First, the user creates an issue or comments on an existing issue to notify
that they’d like to contribute code.
 * Follow our development process step-by-step guide.
 * We advise to contact an `{oak}` core development team directly via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269) before submitting code for complex functionality.


## Type 2 Contribution without Code: 

 * User creates an issue and ideally contacts an `{oak}` team member via [Slack](https://oakgarden.slack.com).
 * The `{oak}` core development team will contact the issue creator as soon
as possible to discuss further details.
