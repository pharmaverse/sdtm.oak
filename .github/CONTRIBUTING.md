# Contribution to {sdtm.oak} 

This outlines how to propose a change to the sdtm.oak package. For more detailed info about contributing to {sdtm.oak}, and other [pharmaverse packages](https://pharmaverse.org/), please see the [Contribution Guide](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/CONTRIBUTING.html) as well as other Developer Guides in the Articles section of the [{admiraldev} website](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/).

Please note that we try to align to best practices used in other R packages' development processes - so veteran developers should be familiar with our processes. However, we do deviate slightly from some best practices and we advise all new contributors to review our package documentation accordingly.


# Basics
 * For each new contribution, the user creates an issue on the issue tab on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/sdtm.oak/issues) to put it in our backlog.
The issues can range from bug identification and/or fixes, enhancements to
functions, documentation, tests or new features.

 * We advise you to contact us when an 
[issue](https://github.com/pharmaverse/sdtm.oak/issues) is created via
[Slack](https://oakgarden.slack.com) (If you don't have access, use this
[link](https://join.slack.com/t/oakgarden/shared_invite/zt-204sf8w5c-Vxl71cI~WAYhsMLbHGxeMw)
to join).  We can discuss details or align expectations if you are not familiar
with the `{sdtm.oak}` philosophy and programming strategy. The team will try to
review the issues within the next backlog meeting and give some initial
feedback. Since we are not a 100% fully resourced software development team it
might be that some issues will take longer to respond to depending on the amount
of overall issues.
