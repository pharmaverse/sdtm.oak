Description: An EDC and Data Standard-agnostic SDTM data transformation engine 
designed for SDTM programming in R. Powered by metadata {sdtm.oak} can automate
the conversion of raw clinical data to SDTM through standardized mapping 
algorithms. SDTM is one of the required standards for data submission to 
FDA (U.S.) and PMDA (Japan). SDTM standards are implemented in accordance with the
SDTM Implemetation guide as defined by CDISC <https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig<
