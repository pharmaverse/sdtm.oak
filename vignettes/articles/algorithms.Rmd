## Core Concept

SDTM mappings are defined as algorithms that transform the collected
(eCRF, eDT) source data into the target SDTM data model. Mapping
algorithms are the backbone of the sdtm.oak - SDTM data transformation
engine.

**Key Points:**

-   Algorithms can be re-used across multiple SDTM domains.

-   Algorithms are pre-specified for data collection standards in MDR
    (if applicable)
    
-   Programming language agnostic - this concept does not rely on a
    specific programming language for implementation. The OAK team
    implemented them as R functions.

Here is an example of reusing an algorithm across multiple domains,
variables, and also to a non-standard

## Sub-algorithms

sdtm.oak supports two levels for defining algorithms. For example, there
are some SDTM mappings where a certain action has to be taken only when
a condition is met. In such cases, the primary algorithm checks for the
condition, and the sub-algorithm executes the mappings when the
condition is met.

Currently, sub-algorithms must be provided for these main algorithms.

-   IF_THEN_ELSE
-   DATASET_LEVEL

Algorithms can be interchangeably used as algorithms and as
sub-algorithms as seen below (not an exhaustive list)

The permutation & combination of algorithms & sub-algorithms creates
endless possibilities to accommodate different types of mappings.
