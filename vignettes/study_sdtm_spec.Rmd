{sdtm.oak} is a metadata-driven solution that is designed to be Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) and standards agnostic. Throughout this article, the term "metadata" 
is used several times. In this context, "metadata" refers to the specific 
metadata used by {sdtm.oak}. This article aims to provide users with a more 
detailed understanding of the {sdtm.oak} metadata.

In general, metadata can be defined as "data about data." It does not include 
any patient-level data. Instead, the metadata provides a blueprint of the data 
that needs to be collected during a study.

## Standards Metadata

The standards metadata used in {sdtm.oak} is sourced from the CDISC Library or 
sponsor MDR or any other form of documentation where standards are maintained. 
This metadata provides information on the following:

- The relationship between Data Collection Standards (eCRF & eDT), SDTM mapping, 
and Controlled Terminology
- Machine-readable standard SDTM mappings
- Algorithms and associated metadata required for the SDTM automation of 
standards in the study.

In the upcoming releases of {sdtm.oak}, we will effectively utilize the 
standards metadata and customize it to meet the study requirements.

## Study Definition Metadata

Study Definition Metadata is also referred to as Study Metadata. Study Definition 
Metadata provides information about the eCRF and eDT data collected in the study.

**eCRF Metadata**
The eCRF Design Metadata is fetched from the EDC system. This Metadata includes

- Forms Metadata: Identifier, eCRF label, Repeating format and other properties of the eCRF.

- Fields Metadata: Identifier, question label, datatype, and other 
properties of data collection fields in the study.

- Data Dictionaries: Identifier and the controlled terms collected at the
source.

- Visits: Name of the visits as defined in the EDC.

**eDT Metadata**

eDT Metadata is the blueprint metadata that describes the data collected as part of that external data transfer (from clinical sites to the sponsor). This includes

- Dataset name, label, repeating properties, etc.

- Variable name, datatype, label and associated codelist, etc.


## Study SDTM Mappings Metadata (specifications)

Study SDTM mappings metadata is the study SDTM specification. To develop the SDTM domains, {sdtm.oak} requires the user to prepare the Study SDTM mappings metadata. Unlike the conventional SDTM specification, which includes one tab per domain defining the target (SDTM domain, Variables) to source (raw dataset, raw variables) and SDTM mappings, the SDTM spec for {sdtm.oak} defines the source-to-target relationship. For each source, the SDTM mapping, algorithms, and associated metadata are defined. The table below presents the columns in the SDTM mapping specification and its explanation.
